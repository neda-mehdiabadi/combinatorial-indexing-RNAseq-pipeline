# combinatorial-indexing-RNAseq-pipeline
**Preprocessing** scripts were used to demultiplex a large-scale combinatorial indexing snRNA-seq protocol and generate a CellxGene matrix.

**Downstream analysis in R** was performed to identify high-quality hashing barcodes, generate a filtered CellxGene matrix, annotate cell types, conduct differential gene expression (DEG) analysis, and integrate snRNA-seq datasets.

**Downstream analysis in Python** included generating input files for model fine-tuning, fine-tuning and evaluating an attention-based transformer to predict core regulatory networks driving dilated cardiomyopathy.
